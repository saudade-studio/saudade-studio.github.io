Saudade Studio's first strategic investment was in Harriet Noy's vision for a
new circular marketplace to allow students to sell their pre-loved items amongst
each other. Hazaar had already managed to reach over 20,000 students with their
Facebook groups which facilitated the exchange of second-hand items at university.

Having proved their was a demand, Harriet, was looking to stage the next step and
turn this into an official application.

Together we were able to create a concept that respected the need to keep carbon
emissions low - unlike tradiitonal marketplaces, the focus would be on individual
campuses. Students would have to physically meet to exchange the goods, using a QR
code scanning system, to discourage long distance deliveries.

With a combination of Flutter to build a cross-platform app and a serverless Django
backend, The new Hazaar app launched in 2021 to great aclaim and maanged to close a
funding round off the back of Saudade Studio's work.
