Despite the fact over 300 million ink cartridges end up in the landfill each year many people still
need to print out of nesssuty and sometimes even purchasing their own equipment at home in the process.

Founded with a mission to create a simple and more sustainable way to print. Printt had already built a small 
network of public printers across 50 student accomodation locations across the UK. Using a rudimentary system
powered by Raspberry Pis and business printers manufactured by sharp alongside a smart business model which
utilised strateigic partners to re-fill the toner and encouraged locations to provide paper to discourage waste..

Having validated their idea they needed to scale to the general public but were facing reliability issues which
span from regular failure of the SD card contained within the Raspberry Pis to student's helping themselves to the
power cables to charge their phones.

We worked with Printt to access a series of industry grade IOT hardware platforms which could meet their
requirements whilst reducing the unit costs accosiated with each device. Using a custom built OpenWRT based
operating sytem and an off the shelf router we were able to not only remove major sources of failure (The
aforementoned SD card and power cable being two of them) reducing a major source of waste. But reduce the unit cost by over 80%.
